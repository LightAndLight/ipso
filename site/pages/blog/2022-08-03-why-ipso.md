title: Why ipso?
---

This post is for everyone who learns about `ipso` and wonders, "Why should I use this?"

The short answer? You shouldn't, unless you want to.

`ipso` is very much a *personal* project. I created it because I wanted a scripting language that I'd
enjoy using. Something that would make writing glue code and throwaway scripts feel good to *me*.

It follows that any attempts by me to *convince* or *persuade* you to use this language would be in
poor taste. Just as I wouldn't argue that you should start liking
[Meshuggah](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eX4GOltUDdA) or [pinapple on
pizza](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hawaiian_pizza), I won't argue that you should value what
`ipso` has to offer. To each their own.

My role as the language designer is to lay out my values and preferences and how they have influenced the
language, so that you can easily decide whether or not it's for you.

The two main forces driving my decisions in `ipso` are my senses of correctness and convenience. To
satisfy my need for correctness, the language has **static types** and achieves **equational
reasoning** through **explicit effects**[^io] with **computation expressions**[^computation-expressions]. In service of convenience, it has **string
interpolation**[^string-interpolation] and **command literals**[^command-literals], and aims to have a
**comprehensive standard library**[^standard-library]. Some features exist for both ends, such as
**anonymous records**[^records] **and variants**[^variants], and **type classes**[^type-classes].

Finally, I'll leave you with some `ipso` code for a [CI
script](https://github.com/LightAndLight/ipso/blob/main/.github/workflows/checkReleaseVersion) I
wrote. Hopefully the features I've described together with the code below give you a sense of
whether or not you'd like to use this language.

```ipso
#! /usr/bin/env ipso

main : IO ()
main =
  comp
    let versionVar = "GITHUB_REF_NAME"
    let versionFile = "ipso-cli/src/version.rs"

    bind mVersionInGit <- env.getvar versionVar
    case mVersionInGit of
      None x ->
        comp
          println "error: $versionVar not set"
          exit.failure
      Some versionInGit ->
        comp
          bind versionLine <- file.read versionFile
          # extract `version` from `pub const VERSION: &str = "version";`
          let versionInRust = 
            versionLine
              |> string.split ' '
              |> array.index 5
              |> string.split '"'
              |> array.index 1
          
          println "$versionVar version: $versionInGit"
          println "$versionFile version: $versionInRust"
          if versionInGit == versionInRust
            then
              comp
                println "success: versions match"
                exit.success
            else
              comp
                println "error: version mismatch"
                exit.failure
```
