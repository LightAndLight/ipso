title: Announcing v0.6
---

Today I released `ipso` v0.6 ([GitHub release](https://github.com/LightAndLight/ipso/releases/tag/
v0.6), [changelog](https://github.com/LightAndLight/ipso/blob/v0.6/CHANGELOG.md#06)). My focus was
adding the backlog of builtin functions that accumulated as I used Ipso for small scripts.
