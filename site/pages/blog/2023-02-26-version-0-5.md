title: Announcing v0.5
---

Today I released `ipso` v0.5 ([GitHub
release](https://github.com/LightAndLight/ipso/releases/tag/v0.5),
[changelog](https://github.com/LightAndLight/ipso/blob/v0.5/CHANGELOG.md#05)). This release
consists of bug fixes and small tweaks.

I recently tested Ipso by writing two small but personally useful programs. The first is [a helper
script](https://github.com/LightAndLight/timespent) for my tracking my time at work. The second is
[a program for resolving Git URIs](https://github.com/LightAndLight/git-explorer). Most of the
issues I fixed in this release came from my work on these programs.
